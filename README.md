# Finyard Front-end Challenge

This repository contains the front-end projects developed for the Finyard case study, including an email template, an animated banner, and a React landing page. Each component is designed with responsiveness and modern web practices in mind.

## Email Template

### Compatibility
The email template has been checked with "Can I Email" for compatibility across different email clients, ensuring a broad range of users can view the email as intended.

### Structure and Styling
- **DOCTYPE**: Uses HTML5 to provide a standard structure.
- **CSS**: Inline styling to ensure compatibility across all email clients, with a focus on responsive design.
- **Fonts**: Web-safe fonts, with fallbacks, ensure text appears consistently across different viewing platforms.

### Testing
The template was rigorously tested across a range of email clients to confirm its functionality and appearance.
